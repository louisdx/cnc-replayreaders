    <h1>EA Replay File Formats</h1>

    <p>Each replay file consists of the following global structure:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Header</li>
      <li>Chunks (variable length, arbitrary in number)</li>
      <li>End-of-chunks terminator</li>
      <li>Footer</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We use the following data types.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>char</strong>: one byte, for use in arrays for plain text</li>
      <li><strong>byte</strong>: one byte, used for numeric values</li>
      <li><strong>uint16_t</strong>: unsigned two-byte integer, stored in little-endian order</li>
      <li><strong>uint32_t</strong>: unsigned four-byte integer, stored in little-endian order</li>
      <li><strong>tb_ch</strong>: An unsigned two-byte value used to represent a BMP Unicode codepoint, stored in little-endian order
      <li><strong>tb_str</strong>: null-terminated array of tb_ch's, to be interpreted as raw BMP Unicode codepoints (?)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is not clear whether two-byte strings are fixed-width strings of raw BMP Unicode codepoints or variable-width UTF-16LE strings.
    In the absence of non-BMP characters, the two are essentially identical.</p>


    <h2>Tiberium Wars / Kane&rsquo;s Wrath / Red Alert 3</h2>

    <h3>Differences</h3>
    <p>In <em>Tiberium Wars</em> and <em>Kane&rsquo;s Wrath</em>, MAGIC_SIZE is 18, U1_SIZE is 33 and U2_SIZE is 19,
    in <em>Red Alert 3</em> MAGIC_SIZE is 17, U1_SIZE is 31 and U2_SIZE is 20.</p>

    <h3>Header</h3>

    <p>The global header structure is as follows. Note that there are small differences depending
    on whether the replay is from a multiplayer or from a skirmish game, distinguished by the value
    of <strong>hnumber1</strong>.</p>

    <div class="listing">char      str_magic[MAGIC_SIZE]; // == "C&amp;C3 REPLAY HEADER" or "RA3 REPLAY HEADER"
byte      hnumber1;              // My guess: skirmish (0x04) vs. multiplayer (0x05)
uint32_t  vermajor;              // 0x01
uint32_t  verminor;              // 0x00,...,0x09
uint32_t  buildmajor;
uint32_t  buildminor;

byte      hnumber2;              // My guess: No commentary = 0x06, with commentary track = 0x1E
byte      zero1;                 // == 0x00

tb_str    match_title;
tb_str    match_description;
tb_str    match_map_name;
tb_str    match_map_id;

byte      number_of_players;
player_t  player_data[number_of_players + 1];  // the additional record at the end might be related to commentating

uint32_t  offset;
uint32_t  str_repl_length;                 // always == 8
char      str_repl_magic[str_repl_length]; // == "CNC3RPL\0"

IF game is Tiberium Wars or Red Alert 3
  char    mod_info[22];
ENDIF

uint32_t   timestamp;

byte       unknown1[U1_SIZE];    // usually all zero

uint32_t   header_len;
char       header[header_len];   // not null-terminated!
byte       replay_saver;
uint32_t   zero3;                // == 0x000000
uint32_t   zero4;                // == 0x000000
uint32_t   filename_length;
tb_ch      filename[filename_length];
tb_ch      date_time[8];
uint32_t   vermagic_len;
char       vermagic[vermagic_len];
uint32_t   magic_hash;
byte       zero4;                 // == 0x00

uint32_2   unknown2[U2_SIZE];</div>

    <p>The header contains a variable number of player records, described by the following <strong>player_t</strong> pseudo-structure of variable length.</p>
    <div class="listing">uint32_t  player_id;
tb_str    player_name;
IF hnumber1 == 0x05
  byte    team_number;
ENDIF</div>

    <p>The values in the header are mostly self-explanatory, though some remarks are in order.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In <em>Tiberium Wars</em> 1.07 and above, and in <em>Red Alert 3</em>, there is a 22-byte field
      <strong>mod_info</strong>. This is tokenized into null-terminated strings with information about the
      mod used for the replay. The default game mod names are "CNC3" and "RA3", respectively. The entire field
      is absent in <em>Kane&rsquo;s Wrath</em> replays and <em>Tiberium Wars</em> up to version 1.06.</li>
      <li>The <strong>timestamp</strong> is a standard Unix timestamp for the date and time in GMT.</li>
      <li><strong>replay_saver</strong> is the 0-based index of the player who saved the replay.</li>
      <li>The values of <strong>date_time</strong> have the following meaning: 0: year, 1: month, 2: weekday (0-6 = Sun-Sat), 3: day, 4: hour, 5: minute, 6: second. The meaning of value 7 is unknown.</li>
      <li>The string <strong>vermagic</strong> consists of a textual represention of the version and build as already contained
      in the corresponding header fields.</li>
      <li>The 32-bit <strong>magic_hash</strong> seems to be an invariant of the game version/mod, but it is not clear how it is derived.</li>
      <li>The value of <strong>offset</strong> is the difference between the beginning of the first chunk and the beginning of the &ldquo;CNC3RPL\0&rdquo; magic
      (<strong>str_repl_magic</strong>).</li>
      <li>The meaning of the data in <strong>unknown1</strong> and <strong>unknown2</strong> is unknown.</li>
      <li>The bulk of header information is contained in the plain-text string <strong>header</strong>. This is a semicolon-separated list of items of the form &ldquo;key&nbsp;=&nbsp;value&rdquo;. When the key is &ldquo;S&rdquo;, the value is a colon-separated list of items. Each item describes one player slot (including observers and commentators), and each item consists of a comma-separated list of tokens. The first token is of the form &ldquo;H<em>name</em>&rdquo;, where <em>name</em> is the player name, or &ldquo;C[E|M|H|B]&rdquo; for computer opponents; the second token is the IP address (ASCII represention of a hexadecimal number), the sixth token specifies the faction. See next section for details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plain-text game info</h3>

    <p>Lauren wrote a very nice description of the <strong>header</strong> plain-text string:</p>
    <div class="listing">GameInfo
      M= [short; unknown][char[]; MapName];
      MC= [int; Map CRC]
      MS= [int; Map File Size]
      SD= [int; Seed?]
      GSID= [short; GameSpy (Match) ID]
      GT= [int; Game...]
      PC= [int; Post Commentator]
      RU= [int; Initial Camera Player] [int; Game Speed] [int; Initial Resources] [bool; Broadcast Game] [bool; Allow Commentary] [int; Tape Delay] [bool; Random Crates] [bool; Enable VoIP] [int; ? -1] [int; ? -1] [int; ? -1] [int; ? -1] [int; ? -1]
      S= [char[]; Player Name],[int; IP],[int; ?],[TT|FT],[int; ?],[Faction],[int; ?],[int; ?],[int; ?],[int; ?],[int; ?],[char[]; Clan Tag]
      
      Annotations:
      M=
      unknown: hex, 12bit
      MS=
      File Size: 0 for custom maps
      GSID=
      GameSpy (Match) ID: hex, 5D91 for Skirmish
      RU=
      Initial Camera Player: 1 based
      S=
      Player Name: (H[uman]PlayerName)|(C[PU](E[asy]|M[edium]|H[ard]|B[rutal]))
      TT|FT: maybe TrueTrue|FalseTrue, FT only when automatched, FT gets TT when commentated for the replay saver
      Faction: 1 based, order corresponds to ini
      Clan Tag: without brackets</div>

    <h3>The replay body</h3>

    <p>The main body of a replay file consists of &ldquo;chunks&rdquo;. Each chunk is of the following form.</p>
    <div class="listing">uint32_t         time_code;
byte             chunk_type;   // 1, 2, 3 or 4
uint32_t         chunk_size;
byte[chunk_size] data;
uint32_t         zero;         // == 0x00000000</div>
    <p>Chunks have to be read consecutively. The end of the chunks is signalled when <strong>time_code</strong> takes the value 0x7FFFFFFF, in which case
    <em>there is no more data following the time code</em> and the footer follows.</p>

    <p>One unit of time code corresponds to two frames, i.e. 1/15th of a second.</p>

    <p>The meaning and structure of replay chunks is discussed further below.</p>

    <h3>Footer</h3>

    <p>The footer contains the time code of the final chunk. This makes it possible to determine the duration
    of the replay without walking through the entire file. The size of the footer, <n>footer_length</n>, is
    stored in the final four bytes of the replay. The footer takes the following form:</p>

    <div class="listing">char      footer_str[17/18];   // ==  "RA3 REPLAY FOOTER"/"C&amp;C3 REPLAY FOOTER"
uint32_t  final_time_code;
byte      data[footer_length - 17/18 - 8];
uint32_t  footer_length;</div>

    <p>The <code>data</code> field is either of length 1 and takes the value 0x02, or otherwise <code>data</code>
    is of the form <code>{ 0x01, 0x02, uint32_t n, byte footer_payload[n] }</code> (so necessarily
    <code>n + 6 + 8 + 17/18 == footer_length</code>). The meaning of <code>footer_payload</code> is unknown,
    although it appears that the final 18 bytes (when <code>n</code> is 32 or 36, in RA3 only) are
    IEEE754 32-bit floats, perhaps the kill/death ratio of players 1 to 6.</p>

    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> While it appears that the footer could in principle have any length, only certain
    specific forms of footers may be recognized by the games.</p>

    <h3>Replay chunks in Tiberium Wars / Kane&rsquo;s Wrath / Red Alert 3</h3>

    <p>Each replay chunk appears to come in one of four types, indicated by the value of <strong>chunk_type</strong>.</p>

    <p>Chunk types 3 and 4 only appear to be present in replays with a commentary track, and it seems that type 3
    contains the audio data and type 4 the telestrator data.</p>

    <p>Let us focus on chunk types 1 and 2. We always have <code>data[0] ==
    1</code>. For chunks of type 2 we also have <code>data[1] == 0</code>. Let us thus
    define the <em>payload data</em> for both chunk types.</p>

    <p><strong>Type 1:</strong> <code>data[chunk_size]</code> has the following structure.</p>
    <div class="listing">byte;              // == 1
uint32_t           number_of_commands;
byte[chunk_size-5] payload;</div>

    <p>The payload contains a number of separate commands, as indicated by <strong>number_of_commands</strong>.
    Each command is terminated by 0xFF, but see below for a detailed discussion.</p>

    <p><strong>Type 2:</strong> <code>data[chunk_size]</code> has the following structure.</p>
    <div class="listing">byte;       // == 1
byte;       // == 0
uint32_t n; // player number, index in the player list in the plain-text game info
byte;       // == 0x0E in TW/KW, 0x0F in RA3
uint32_t c; // == time_code;
byte[chunk_size-11] payload;</div>

    <p>It appears that type-2 chunks only ever appear with chunk_size
    24 or 40. The chunk data, starting at <code>payload + 12</code>, appears to
    consist of 3 or 7 IEEE754 32-bit floating point values. The first
    three appear to be map coordinates (<var>x</var>, <var>z</var>,
    <var>y</var>) in units of feet, and the last four values
    appear to determine the camera angle and zoom. Specifically,
    the structure of <code>payload</code> appears to be as follows:</p>

    <div class="listing">byte      flags;        // 0x01: position, 0x02: rotation
IF flags & 0x01
  float32 position[3];  // (x, z, height) in units of feet
ENDIF
IF flags & 0x02
  float32 rotation[4];  // quaternion components?
ENDIF</div>

    <p>It is almost certain that chunks of type 2 contain camera
    movement data, and <code>n</code> is the player number, a
    zero-based index into the list of players that appears in the
    plain-text header, as well as a &ldquo;heartbeat&rdquo;. Chunks of
    type 1 contain user actions that actually affect the gameplay, as well
    as another set of heartbeats.</p>

    <h3>Heartbeats</h3>

    <p>Several types of replay data get generated automatically and regularly without
    any user action. Let us call these &ldquo;heartbeats&rdquo; collectively. The nature
    of this data is not known, but it stands to reason that it serves to confirm the
    integrity of the game state across the multiple players.</p>

    <p>Each active player creates a type-2 heartbeat once every second, for every logical
    frame that is a multiple of 15, as well as right at the very start, at timecode 1. This
    chunk is always 40 bytes long and appears to contain the complete camera configuration
    at that point.</p>

    <p>There are also heartbeats in the type-1 chunks: In <em>Red
    Alert 3</em>, every three seconds, when the timecode is of the
    form 45<var>k</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, each player emits a heartbeat
    command with ID 0x21. In <em>Tiberium Wars</em> and
    <em>Kane&rsquo;s Wrath</em>, a similar heartbeat occurs every 30
    seconds at timecodes 450<var>k</var>&nbsp;+&nbsp;4 (or sometimes
    +&nbsp;3), and the command ID is respectively 0x57 and 0x61.</p>

    <p>Further, there is another command, currently misdubbed
    &ldquo;scroll&rdquo; (though it appears to have nothing to do with
    the camera), which is emitted irregularly, yet for each player in
    equal number and at a rate of roughly one every two seconds. Its
    ID is 0x85, 0x8F and 0x37 respectively in TW/KW/RA3.</p>

    <h3>Type-1 Command Chunks</h3>

    <p>Chunks of type 1 contain a variable number of commands; the number of commands is stored in <strong>number_of_commands</strong> and
    the actual command codes are contained in <strong>payload</strong>. Each command is of the following form:</p>
    <div class="listing">byte   command_id;
byte   player_id;
byte   code[command_size - 3];
byte   terminator; // == 0xFF</div>

    <p>The value of <strong>command_size</strong> depends on the command type, which is determined by <strong>command_id</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some commands are of fixed size.</li>
      <li>Some few commands are of variable size that need special treatment. There may be a
          either a set of fixed options, or there may be a size value somewhere in the command.
          See the replay reader source code for those special cases.</li>
      <li>The majority of commands are of variable size but of <strong>standard layout</strong>.
          This layout depends on a single offset parameter, <strong>n</strong>, and is described
          below.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Standard-layout variable-sized commands.</strong> A command of standard layout
    with offset <code>n</code> has the following form:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>payload[0]</code>: Command ID</li>
      <li><code>payload[1]</code>: Player ID</li>
      <li>If <code>n</code>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2, here come <code>n</code>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2 bytes
          of command header.</li>
      <li>Here comes a loop: Let <code>x</code> be a byte, and set <code>x = payload[n];</code>.
          <ul>
            <li>If <code>x == 0xFF</code> stop, you have reached the end of the command.
            <li>Let <code>c = (x >> 4) + 1;</code>, i.e. take the upper four bits of <code>x</code> and add one.</li>
            <li>Read in <code>c</code> values that are 32-bit integers.
            <li>Read in one more byte and assign it to <code>x</code>, and repeat the loop.
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li>It is unknown whether the lower four bits of <code>x</code> have any
          relevance. The only observed values are 0, 4 and 5.
    </ol>

    <p>The player IDs in type-1 chunk commands appear to relate to the player index in the plain-text header by
       a simple formula: <code>index = player_id / 8 - k</code>, where <code>k</code> is 3 for <em>Tiberium
       Wars</em> and <em>Kane&rsquo;s Wrath</em> and 2 for <em>Red Alert 3</em>.</p>

    <p>The creator of <a href="http://www.airlea.nl/kwrt/">TW/KW Replay Tool</a>, <em>Wmm</em>, has generously provided
    his findings on the command types for <em>Red Alert 3</em>. The command-size column either contains a single
    number for a fixed-size command, &ldquo;std: <var>n</var>&rdquo; for a command in standard layout with offset <var>n</var>,
    or &ldquo;special&rdquo; for variable-length commands that require special treatment.</p>

    <h2>Tiberian Twilight</h2>

    <p>The replay format of <em>Tiberian Twilight</em> is a lot simpler than that of previous games. The header is less redundant, and header fields
    start at fixed offsets, making direct parsing easier. The chunks are no longer separated by four zero bytes, and there are only two chunk types
    (types 1 and 2), on account of the absence of a commentary/telestrator feature. Zero-terminated two-byte strings appear padded with zeros inside
    regions of fixed size on multiple occasions.</p>

    <h3>Header</h3>

char             vermagic[vermagic_len];
uint32_t         magic_hash;

/* Lots of sparse data, not yet analysed */

</div>

    <p>The <strong>player_data_t</strong> data contains the player ID, team number
    (always 0 or 1) and the player's name, as a tb_str padded to 64 bytes:</p>

    <div class="listing">uint32_t         player_id;
uint32_t         player_team;       // either 0 or 1
char             player_name[64];   // padded tb_str</div>


    <h3>The replay body</h3>

    <p>The replay body consists of a sequence of chunks. The first chunk starts at the fixed offset <strong>0xFA8</strong>.
    Chunks are of this form:</p>
    <div class="listing">uint32_t         time_code;
uint16_t         chunk_type;  // either 1 or 2
uint16_t         chunk_size;
byte             data[chunk_size];</div>

    <p><strong>Type 1:</strong> data[chunk_size] has the following structure.</p>
    <div class="listing">uint16_t         chunk_code;     // ???
uint32_t         number_of_commands;
byte             payload[chunk_size - 6];</div>
    <p>The payload contains a number of separate commands, as indicated by <strong>number_of_commands</strong>.
    Each command is terminated by the three bytes {0x00, 0x00, 0xFF}.</p>

    <p><strong>Type 2:</strong> data[chunk_size] has the following structure.</p>
    <div class="listing">byte              chunk_code;    // ????
byte[2];                         // == { 0x01, 0x00 }
uint32_t          player_number; // 0 to 9 (?)
byte;                            // == 0x05;
uint32_t          tc;            // == time_code
byte              payload[chunk_size - 12];</div>
    <p>Like in the previous games, type-2 chunks contain a player number, followed by a fixed byte (here 0x05), followed by
    the chunk timecode again.</p>

    <p><strong>End of replay:</strong> The replay finishes when <strong>time_code == 0xFFFFFFFF</strong> and
    <strong>chunk_type == 0xFFFF</strong>. In that event, <strong>chunk_size</strong> contains the length of
    the footer, and the replay is concluded by as many bytes, which constitute the footer. (In that sense,
    the footer is merely another chunk of type 0xFFFF.)</p>

    <p>It appears that the footer chunk size is always 64, so the footer chunk is 72 bytes long. It is plausible
    that part of the footer (the final 48 byte?) are 12 IEEE754 floats related to the kill/death ratio.</p>


    <h2>Generals, Zero Hour, Battle for Middle Earth, Rise of the Witch King</h2>

    <p>The replay format of the games <em>Generals</em>, <em>Zero
    Hour</em>, <em>Battle for Middle Earth</em>, <em>Battle for Middle
    Earth 2</em>, and its expansion <em>Rise of the Witch King</em>
    is considerably simpler than that of the later games. Most
    notably, the chunks do not have length information, so one must
    know their sizes by other means. Also, there is no footer, just a
    final chunk.</p>

    <h3>Header</h3>

    <p>The size <var>u1</var> is 12 for <em>Generals</em> and <em>Zero Hour</em>, and 21 in the BfME games; <var>u2</var> is 8 in CCG/ZH and 13 in the BfME games; <var>u3</var> is 4 except in BfME2, where it is 6.</p>

    <div class="listing">char             str_magic[6/8];     // == "GENREP", "BFMEREPL" or "BFME2RPL"
uint32_t         timestamp_begin;
uint32_t         timestamp_end;
byte             unknown1[u1];
tb_str           str_filename;
tb_ch            date_time[8];       // as in TW/KW
tb_str           str_version;
tb_str           str_build_date;
uint16_t         version_minor;
uint16_t         version_major;
byte             magic_hash[u2]
char             header[];           // null-terminated!
uint16_t         unknown2;
uint32_t         unkonwn3[u3];</div>

    <p><strong>Remarks.</strong> The two timestamps appear to indicate the real-world start and end time of the game. The <strong>header</strong> is of the same format as the later games.</p>

    <h3>The replay body</h3>

    <p>The replay body consists of a sequence of <em>chunks</em>. Each chunk is of the following form:</p>
    <div class="listing">uint32_t         time_code;
uint32_t         chunk_code;
uint32_t         number;         // Player number?
byte             number_of_commands;
struct { byte cmd, byte nargs } signature[number_of_commands];
byte             arguments[];    // variable!</div>
    <p>In the simplest case, <strong>number_of_commands</strong> is
    zero and <strong>signature</strong> and <strong>arguments</strong>
    are empty. Otherwise, there are <strong>number_of_commands</strong> many
    pairs of bytes {<strong>cmd</strong>,<strong>nargs</strong>}, where <strong>cmd</strong>
    refers to one of about ten commands and <strong>nargs</strong> is the
    number of arguments. The size of an argument depends on the command type.
    Finally, <strong>arguments</strong> consists of all the arguments of all
    the commands, simply one after the other.</p>

    <p>The meaning of the chunk codes is unknown in general. Only a handful of values
    seem to occur, all in the range 0x300 &ndash; 0x500, and 0x1B, 0x1D. Many codes only
    ever seem to appear with a fixed, specific signature of commands.</p>

    <p>These are the known commands and their argument sizes.</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>command</th><th>argument size (bytes)</th><th>Description/Notes</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>0x00</td><td>4</td><td>?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x01</td><td>4</td><td>?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x02</td><td>1</td><td>?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x03</td><td>4</td><td>?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x04</td><td>4</td><td>?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x06</td><td>12</td><td>3 uint32_t's? 1 long double?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x07</td><td>12</td><td>3 uint32_t's? 1 long double?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x08</td><td>16</td><td>4 uint32_t's?</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x09</td><td>4/16</td><td>4 bytes in BFME2, 16 otherwise</td></tr>
        <tr><td>0x0A</td><td>4</td><td>4 uint32_t's?</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>There is no footer. The final chunk has <strong>number_of_commands</strong> set to zero, and it appears to have command code 0x1B or 0x1D.</p>

    <h2>Utility functions</h2>

    <p>Here is an example function for converting a raw Unicode codepoint into a UTF-8-encoded string
    (restricted to at most 4 bytes, not the theoretical maxiumum of 6 bytes).</p>
    <div class="listing">typedef union _codepoint_t
{
  char c[4];
  unsigned char u[4];
  unsigned int i;
} codepoint_t;

void codepointToUTF8(unsigned int cp, codepoint_t * szOut)
{
  size_t len = 0;

  szOut-&gt;u[0] = szOut-&gt;u[1] = szOut-&gt;u[2] = szOut-&gt;u[3] = 0;

  if (cp &lt; 0x0080) len++;
  else if (cp &lt; 0x0800) len += 2;
  else len += 3;

  int i = 0;
  if (cp &lt; 0x0080)
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = (unsigned char) cp;
  else if (cp &lt; 0x0800)
  {
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = 0xc0 | (( cp ) &gt;&gt; 6 );
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = 0x80 | (( cp ) &amp; 0x3F );
  }
  else
  {
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = 0xE0 | (( cp ) &gt;&gt; 12 );
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = 0x80 | (( ( cp ) &gt;&gt; 6 ) & 0x3F );
    szOut-&gt;u[i++] = 0x80 | (( cp ) &amp; 0x3F );
  }
}

// Result can be retrieved e.g. via std::string(szOut-&gt;c)</div>

    <p>The above function can be used to read a null-terminated string of type <strong>tb_str</strong> and
    store the result as a UTF-8-encoded string:</p>

    <div class="listing">std::string read2ByteString(std::istream & in)
{
  codepoint_t     ccp;
  char        cbuf[2];
  std::string       s;

  while (true)
  {
    in.read(&amp;cbuf, 2);
    if (cbuf[0] == 0 &amp;&amp; cbuf[1] == 0) break;
    codepointToUTF8(((unsigned int)(cbuf[1]) &lt;&lt; 8) | ((unsigned int)(cbuf[0])), &amp;ccp);
    s += std::string(ccp.c);
  }

  return s;
}</div>
